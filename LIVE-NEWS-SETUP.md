## 📝 Example Real News

Instead of simulated news like:
```
❌ "NSE Nifty 50 Shows Strong Performance" (Simulation)
```

You now get REAL news like:
```
✅ "HDFC Bank Q4 Results: Net profit rises 18% YoY to ₹16,512 crore"
   Source: Economic Times • 2h ago

✅ "RBI keeps repo rate unchanged at 6.5%; hikes CRR"

```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing simulated news
**Fix:** 
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Clear cache
4. Wait 5 minutes for cache to expire

### Issue: Not many articles
**Fix:** Normal - RSS feeds may have fewer articles at certain times
- Economic Times: 10-15 articles
- Moneycontrol: 5-10 articles
- CryptoPanic: 5-10 articles
- Total: 15-25 articles typically

### Issue: Some sources not working
