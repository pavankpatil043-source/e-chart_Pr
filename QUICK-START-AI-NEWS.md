## 🚀 Setup Steps (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Free Hugging Face API Key
1. Visit: https://huggingface.co/join
2. Sign up (free - takes 30 seconds)
3. Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
4. Click **"New token"** button
5. Name it: "News Summarizer"
6. Select: **"Read"** access
7. Click **"Generate"**
8. **Copy the token** (starts with `hf_...`)

### Step 2: Add API Key to Environment
1. Create `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add this line (replace with your actual key):
```bash
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_actual_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```powershell
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Test Without API Key

The system works WITHOUT an API key, but:
- ❌ No AI summaries (just uses first 3 sentences)
- ✅ Market Impact scores still work
- ✅ Stock detection still works

**Add API key for full AI-powered summaries!**

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check if API key is working:
```powershell
# In your terminal, run:
$env:HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY
```

If empty, key is not loaded. Make sure:
1. `.env.local` file exists
2. File has correct name (not `.env.local.txt`)
3. Server was restarted after adding key

### Browser Console Logs:
```
🤖 Starting AI summarization for 10 articles...
✅ AI summarization complete: 10 summaries
```

### Server Logs:
```
🤖 Summarizing 10 articles...
✅ Successfully summarized 10 articles
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Free Tier Limits
- **30,000 API calls per month** (free)
- Each news panel load = ~10-20 calls
- Can handle **1,500+ news loads per month**

### 2. Processing Time
- Batches of 3 articles at a time
- ~2-3 seconds per batch
- Total: 5-10 seconds for 10-15 articles

### 3. Fallback Strategy
If AI fails:
- Uses first 3 sentences from article
- Still calculates market impact
- Still detects affected stocks

### 4. Caching
- Summaries cached in component state
- Re-fetches only when:
  - Page refreshed
  - Category/sentiment filter changed
  - Manual refresh button clicked

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Summary Length
Edit `app/api/summarize-news/route.ts`:
```typescript
parameters: {
  max_length: 150,  // Longer summaries
  min_length: 50,   // More detailed
}
```

### Add More Stocks
```typescript
const INDIAN_STOCKS = [
  { symbol: "ADANIENT.NS", names: ["adani", "adani enterprises"] },
  // Add yours here...
]
```

### Adjust Impact Scoring
```typescript
const MARKET_IMPACT_KEYWORDS = {
  high: ["crisis", "crash", ...],  // Add keywords
  medium: ["growth", ...],
  low: ["meeting", ...],
}
```

## ✨ What's Next?

Once this works, you can add:
1. **Cache summaries in database** (avoid re-processing)
2. **Real-time summarization** (as news loads)
3. **Multi-language support** (Hindi/regional news)
4. **Sentiment re-analysis** (AI-powered sentiment from summary)
5. **Click-to-trade** (add trade button for mentioned stocks)
