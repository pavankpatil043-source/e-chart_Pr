## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Wait for Confluence**: 3+ indicators agreeing
2. **Volume Confirms**: No volume = weak signal
3. **Fibonacci First**: Start with key levels
4. **BB Squeeze**: Big move coming (up or down)
5. **RSI Extremes**: Best signals at <30 or >70

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Trading single indicator (no confluence)
❌ Ignoring volume (low volume = unreliable)
❌ Fighting the trend (RSI can stay extreme)
❌ No stop loss (always protect capital)
❌ Overtrading (wait for clear setups)

✅ Use confluence (multiple indicators)
✅ Require volume confirmation
✅ Trade with the trend
✅ Always use stop loss
✅ Be patient (quality over quantity)

## 📊 Expected Accuracy

| Setup Quality | Expected Win Rate |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 4/4 indicators aligned + high volume | 75-85% |
| 3/4 indicators aligned + good volume | 65-75% |
| 2/4 indicators aligned + normal volume | 55-65% |
| Mixed signals + low volume | 50% (coin flip) |

**Remember**: Past performance does not guarantee future results.

## 🎯 Your Checklist Before Trading

Before clicking BUY/SELL, verify:

- [ ] RSI confirms (not extreme opposite direction)
- [ ] Bollinger position makes sense
- [ ] Volume is decent (> 1x average minimum)
- [ ] Fibonacci level nearby (not in dead zone)
- [ ] Risk level acceptable
- [ ] Stop loss placed
- [ ] Position sized appropriately

**If 5+ boxes checked → Trade has merit**
**If < 4 boxes checked → Wait for better setup**

## 📞 Quick Help

**Q: RSI is 72 but chart says BUY?**
A: Check other indicators. Maybe at strong Fib support + BB lower band. Confluence overrides single indicator.

**Q: All indicators say BUY but low volume?**
A: WAIT. Low volume signals are unreliable. Confidence will be reduced.

**Q: What if RSI and BB disagree?**
A: Look to Fibonacci and Volume for tiebreaker. Whichever has more confluence wins.

**Q: When to override the AI?**
A: Major news event, earnings, or you have information the indicators don't capture.
